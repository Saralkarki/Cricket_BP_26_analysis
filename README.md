This study is a replication of the study ?AN ANALYSIS OF PLAYERS? PERFORMANCES IN THE FIRST CRICKET TWENTY20 WORLD CUP SERIES by Hermanus H. LEMMER.? In this study LEMMER looks at how the batting and bowling performance measure for one day international can be adapted for use in Twenty20 matches, specifically in the case of very small matches. These measure are then taken and used to give rankings of the batsman and bowlers who performed the best in the entire T20 series.

LEMMER takes a look at the 2007 data for the study, and whilst replicating the study question, I take a look at the data from the 2013 T20 World Cup held in Bangladesh. My goal is to compare Nepali batsmen who were playing their first international T20 World Cup with the rest of the players.

Finally, I am replicating this paper as a practice dataset for data analysis using python.
